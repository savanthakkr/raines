                        <h6>Note:</h6>
                        <p>A risk management plan is a set of procedures and documents that form the basis of your risk management identification protocols. The risk management plan is the framework that develops the benchmarks of your WHS systems. By following a set of standard protocols, we can achieve results that are mappable, reliable, consistent, current and effective.</p>

                        <p className="mt-3 mb-0">The acronym ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) is often used in industry where there is a remaining level of risk (low). Ostensibly there is always a risk. We progress with our daily duties when we have controlled the risk as per the “ALARP” theory. As we have applied controls, there are other such controls:</p>
                        <ol className="mb-0">

                            Just to name a few, there are many variations across all sites. At Hazard Report part 2 the question “are the risks unacceptable?” should have an answer of “Yes” as there are always control measures in place at mine sites and construction sites. If you were to answer “No” there would be no Hazard and no Risk. By selecting “No” you will have defeated the purpose of assignment. (you would be diverted to the Review process precluding you from displaying competence in the entire unit of competency).
